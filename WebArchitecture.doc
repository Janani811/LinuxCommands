DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM ( DNS )
•	DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources. 
•	Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device. 
•	DNS servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses such as 192.168.

WWW
•	The World Wide Web—commonly referred to as WWW, W3, or the Web.
•	It is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators, which may be interlinked by hyperlinks, and are accessible over the Internet.
•	Web is an interconnected system of public webpages accessible through the Internet. 
•	The Web is not the same as the Internet.
•	The Web is one of many applications built on top of the Internet.



HTTP
•	The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers.
•	HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server.
Example: A client (browser) sends an HTTP request to the server; then the server returns a response to the client. The response contains status information about the request and may also contain the requested content.
Web Server 
•	A web server is a computer that stores web server software and a website's component files. (for example, HTML documents, images, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files) .
•	A web server connects to the Internet and supports physical data interchange with other devices connected to the web.
•	There are mainly four types of web servers – Apache, IIS, Nginx and LiteSpeed.
Web Browsers
•	A web browser is a software application for accessing information on the World Wide Web. 
•	When a user requests a web page from a particular website, the web browser retrieves the necessary content from a web server and then displays the page on the user's device.
•	Common web browsers include Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari. 
HTTP Verbs
•	The following methods are used  to create, read, update, and delete (or CRUD) operations, respectively. 
•	GET is used to request data from a specified resource.
•	POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.
•	PUT is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.
•	The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.
•	HEAD is almost identical to GET, but without the response body.
•	PATCH request method applies partial modifications to a resource
REQUEST and RESPONSE Headers
•	Request headers contain more information about the resource to be fetched, or about the client requesting the resource. 
•	Response headers hold additional information about the response, like its location or about the server providing it.
Cookies
•	A cookie is a small amount of data generated by a website and saved by your web browser.
•	Its purpose is to remember information about you, similar to a preference file created by a software application.
Session
•	A session is a global variable stored on the server
•	Each session is assigned a unique id which is used to retrieve stored values. 
•	Whenever a session is created, a cookie containing the unique session id is stored on the user's computer and returned with every request to the server.
HTTPs
•	Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is used for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the Internet. In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Security or, formerly, Secure Sockets Layer.
